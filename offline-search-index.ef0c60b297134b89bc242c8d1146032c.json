Honestly I haven’t played more than 10 minutes just to get it running, but after the effort I have down the proper steps that work with Azahar, Azahar Plus, and Citra for Android. As of this writing thats:\nAzahar Plus build 204fde666 Azahar 2123.3 Citra 988f294 I’ve tested this out with my Ayn Thor 2025 model (in case there’s another model in the future), running Android 13.\nSteps Go to Fan Translators International and follow their instructions.\nClearly you’re going to do this with a person copy of Time Travelers that you’ve dumped yourself rom your own legally owned version. When you are done, you will have a folder 000400000008C600.\nMake sure your Time Travelers.3ds or Time Travelers.cci file is in your Nintendo 3DS ROM directory. For example: /storage/emulated/0/Roms/roms/n3ds.\nThe next step will depend on what emulator you’re using.\nAzahar and Azahar-Plus, you would have set the user folder, for example: /storage/emulated/0/Documents/azahar. Citra, it’s automatically set to /storage/emulated/0/citra-emu. If using Azahar or Azahar Plus, go to Settings -\u003e Thor settings -\u003e Is it force start selinux. For some reason, this isn’t required with Citra.\nPersonal note: This step drove me crazy until I figured out this was required. I don’t know what this setting is for, so use with caution. For whichever emulator, follow these steps:\nFor the emulator of choice, go to the user folder. There are two folders you either need to create or look for:\nload/mods sdmc/luma/titles Copy the *entire 000400000008C600 file into both of the folders above. I don’t know why you need it in both, but it doesn’t work otherwise. So by the end you’ll have:\nload/mods/000400000008C600 sdmc/luma/titles/000400000008C600 Launch the game. At this point, you’ll see the Time Travelers image file:\nThat should do it!\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The game Time Travelers is a sort of visual novel choice driven game. …","ref":"/docs/games/guides/time-travelers-android/","tags":"","title":"Time Travelers English Translation for Android"}]
